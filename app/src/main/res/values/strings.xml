        This project has been modified to implement material design as per the project requirement of Project 5 "Make Your App Material"
        under Udacity Android Nanodegree program.
        Main focus was on usage of CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout, CollapsingToolbarLayout to manipulate toolbar, scrolling, etc.
        Enter/Exit transitions were also implemented.
        Adjusting the app layout for multiple screens was also implemented.
